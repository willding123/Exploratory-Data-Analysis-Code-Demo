# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Code-Demo
A code demonstration to prepare students at Emory for DataFest, an annual data hackathon. This notebook includes basic exploratory data analysis steps including: importing packages, loading data, examining dataset, dropping irrevalant columns, dropping na/null/duplicated rows, detecting outliers, and some visualizations 


I modeled my exploratory analysis based on Mr. Prabhu's medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python-c9a77dfa39ce
The data I uploaded is from Kaggle.
